# FibonacciTDD
Example of TDD on recursive data structure

Small example on testing a method that returns Fibonacci's number.

The tests check if an illegal argument is passed and an exception is thrown, whether the recursion stops if number 1 or 0 is passed, and the correctness of the algorithm itself.
